HaxeWumbo
=========
  A basic 2d Game Framework for the Haxe programming language.  It is based on prinicipals from Love2D.  I abandoned it a couple months ago when it had begun showing signs of performance problems.  It will should be replaced in the future with a C++ variant if I get around to it.
